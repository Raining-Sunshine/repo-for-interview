# repo-for-interview
I created this repo specially for interview, I am putting my works related to application in this repo.

This repo included my three most code related works, COMSOL void genretation is the code I used in my work Multi-receptor skin with highly sensitive tele-perception somatosensory, this code generatred random pores and particles. I pasted two methods code into one document for management. The capture-upload part shows my ability in controlling hardware with code, I wrote it for my master project about detecting spores with AI, the Yolo-local one is the script I used for AI training, through I eventually trained everthing on Google colab.
